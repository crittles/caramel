# caramel â˜•

A theme collection of my custom palette caramel, it is based on the colors of a common paper coffee cup with sleeves. Most of the stuff in the repository focuses on aesthetics rather than functionality which you may notice some controls are hidden and disabled. The state of this repository is active and maintained by me. Any updates made could be unstable or broken, but feel free to open up an issue.
